Model optimization plays a crucial role in unlocking the maximum performance capabilities of the underlying hardware. By
applying various transformation techniques, models can be optimized to fully utilize the specific features offered by
the hardware architecture to improve the inference performance and cost. Furthermore, in many cases allow for
serialization of models, separating them from the source code. The serialization process enhances portability, allowing
the models to be seamlessly deployed in production environments. The decoupling of models from the source code also
facilitates maintenance, updates, and collaboration among developers. However, this process comprises multiple steps and
offers various potential paths, making manual execution complicated and time-consuming.

The [Triton Model Navigator](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_navigator) offers a user-friendly and
automated solution for optimizing and deploying machine learning models. Using a single entry point for
various supported frameworks, allowing users to start the process of searching for the best deployment option with a
single call to the dedicated `optimize` function. Model Navigator handles model export, conversion, correctness testing,
and profiling to select optimal model format and save generated artifacts for inference deployment on the
[PyTriton](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/pytriton)
or [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server).

The high-level flowchart below illustrates the process of moving models from source code to deployment optimized formats
with the support of the Model Navigator:

## Documentation

The full documentation about optimizing models, using Navigator Package and deploying models in PyTriton and/or Triton
Inference Server can be found in [documentation](https://triton-inference-server.github.io/model_navigator).

## Support Matrix

The Model Navigator generates multiple optimized and production-ready models. The table below illustrates the model
formats that can be obtained by using the Model Navigator with various frameworks.

**Table:** Supported conversion target formats per each supported Python framework or file.

| **PyTorch**        | **TensorFlow 2**       | **JAX**                | **ONNX** |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Torch Compile      | SavedModel             | SavedModel             | TensorRT |
| TorchScript Trace  | TensorRT in TensorFlow | TensorRT in TensorFlow |          |
| TorchScript Script | ONNX                   | ONNX                   |          |
| Torch-TensorRT     | TensorRT               | TensorRT               |          |
| ONNX               |                        |                        |          |
| TensorRT           |                        |                        |          |

**Note:** The Model Navigator has the capability to support any Python function as input. However, in this particular
case, its role is limited to profiling the function without generating any serialized models.

The Model Navigator stores all artifacts within the `navigator_workspace`. Additionally, it provides an option to save
a portable and transferable `Navigator Package` - an artifact that includes only the models with minimal latency and
maximal throughput. This package also includes base formats that can be used to regenerate the `TensorRT` plan on the
target hardware.

**Table:** Model formats that can be generated from saved `Navigator Package` and from model sources.

| **From model source** | **From Navigator Package** |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| SavedModel            | TorchTensorRT              |
| TensorFlowTensorRT    | TensorRT in TensorFlow     |
| TorchScript Trace     | ONNX                       |
| TorchScript Script    | TensorRT                   |
| Torch 2 Compile       |                            |
| TorchTensorRT         |                            |
| ONNX                  |                            |
| TensorRT              |                            |

## Quick Start

This sections describe simple steps of optimizing the model for serving inference on PyTriton or Triton Inference Server
as well as saving a Navigator Package for distribution.

### Optimize Model

Optimizing models using Model Navigator is as simply as calling `optimize` function. The optimization process requires
at least:

- `model` - a Python object, callable or file path with model to optimize.
- `dataloader` - a method or class generating input data. The data is utilized to determine the maximum and minimum
  shapes of the model inputs and create output samples that are used during the optimization process.

Here is an example of running `optimize` on Torch Hub ResNet50 model:

```python
import torch
import model_navigator as nav

package = nav.torch.optimize(
    model=torch.hub.load('NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples:torchhub', 'nvidia_resnet50', pretrained=True).eval(),
    dataloader=[torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256) for _ in range(10)],
)
```

Once the model has been optimized the created artifacts are stored in `navigator_workspace` and a Package object is
returned from the function. Read more about optimize
in [documentation](https://triton-inference-server.github.io/model_navigator/latest/package/package/)

### Deploy model in PyTriton

The [PyTriton](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/pytriton) can be used to serve inference of any optimized
format. Model Navigator provide a dedicated `PyTritonAdapter` to retrieve the `runner` and other information required
to bind model for serving inference. The `runner` is an abstraction that connects the model checkpoint with its
runtime, making the inference process more accessible and straightforward.

Following that, you can initialize the PyTriton server using the adapter information:

```python
pytriton_adapter = nav.pytriton.PyTritonAdapter(package=package, strategy=nav.MaxThroughputStrategy())
runner = pytriton_adapter.runner

runner.activate()


@batch
def infer_func(**inputs):
    return runner.infer(inputs)


with Triton() as triton:
    triton.bind(
        model_name="resnet50",
        infer_func=infer_func,
        inputs=pytriton_adapter.inputs,
        outputs=pytriton_adapter.outputs,
        config=pytriton_adapter.config,
    )
    triton.serve()
```

Read more about deploying model on PyTriton
in [documentation](https://triton-inference-server.github.io/model_navigator/latest/pytriton/pytriton_deployment/)

### Deploy model in Triton Inference Server

The optimized model can be also used for serving inference
on [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) when the serialized format has been
created. Model Navigator provide functionality to generate a model deployment configuration directly inside
Triton `model_repository`. The following command will select the
model format with the highest throughput and create the Triton deployment in defined path to model repository:

```python
nav.triton.model_repository.add_model_from_package(
    model_repository_path=pathlib.Path("model_repository"),
    model_name="resnet50",
    package=package,
    strategy=nav.MaxThroughputStrategy(),
)
```

Once the entry is created, you can simply
start [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server)
mounting the defined `model_repository_path`. Read more about deploying model on Triton Inference Server
in [documentation](https://triton-inference-server.github.io/model_navigator/latest/triton/triton_deployment/)

### Using Navigator Package

The `Navigator Package` is an artifact that can be produced at the end of the optimization process. The package is a simple
Zip file which contains the optimization details, model metadata and serialized formats and can be saved using:

```python
nav.package.save(
    package=package,
    path="/path/to/package.nav"
)
```

The package can be easily loaded on other machines and used to re-run the optimization process or profile the model. Read
more about using package
in [documentation](https://triton-inference-server.github.io/model_navigator/latest/package/package/).

## Examples

We provide step-by-step [examples](examples) that demonstrate how to use various features of Model Navigator.
For the sake of readability and accessibility, we use a simple `torch.nn.Linear` model as an example.
These [examples](examples) illustrate how to optimize, test and deploy the model on
the [PyTriton](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/pytriton)
and [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server).
